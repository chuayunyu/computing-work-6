teacher only wants the best of us 
calls us in class when we can't answer
so annoying indeed
but the teacher wants the best of us
so appreciate them when you can
teacher may seem mean and mad
maybe they have anger issues
but after all they are pretty patient 
so appreciate them when you can
because teacher wants the best of us
how can you show appreciation?
listen in class
be respectful
be cooperative
be helpful
do your work 
help your friends
be a role model 
and the teacher's pet (in a good way)
