It was 5.20PM. The streetlights turned on. Claudia was on her way home. She stopped by at a bench, took a seat, and admired the sunset. 
"Mom? Can you hear me? I'm doing fine, what about you?" Claudia reached her hand to the sky. "I miss you so much..." 
She opened her eyes. "Hello, can you hear me? Please wake up! Please I beg you!" It was an unfamilliar voice. He seemed worried sick. Was he worried for me? Where am I...
"Who...who are you." I said, as I choked on blood. I slowly sat up. This is...my apartment? There was blood all over the walls. 
"Are you okay?" the boy said. He seemed around my age, he was wearing a cute t-shirt with a jacket. Hold on, isn't it 30 degrees outside? But I have never seen him in my life. That's strange,
What was he doing in my house?
